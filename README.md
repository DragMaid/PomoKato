<h2 align="center"> A pomodoro timer ripoff of pomofocus written in Python </h2>

# About the project
Inspired by [pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/), the app was made in the python programming language with kivy framework to replicate most of the experience you can have with an offline Pomodoro timer.  The code is written by an amateur and therefore may be a bit hard to look at or even comprehend what is going on. But despite all the downsides, I am sure it should be enough to satisfy most of your basic needs and will hopefully improve your study sessions. 

# Features
- ## Study -  Break - Long break

- ## Highly modifiable
  > Since the code was written in python, you can easily change or modify any component of the app to meet your need ( I use [safeeyes](https://github.com/slgobinath/SafeEyes) to keep myself away from the screen and get a good stretch before the next study session)
  > Or you can add in your thread and execute any program you would like to run at the end of each session
# :warning: Warning :warning:
The app has only been run on Arch Linux and hasn't proven to be usable on the distros as well as OS without any kind of tweaking or modification
# Dependency
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) ( recently tested on version >= 3.6.5 )
- [kivy](https://kivy.org/#home)
- [kivymd](https://kivymd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [safeeyes](https://github.com/slgobinath/SafeEyes) ( optional so you can remove it in the main.py file )
- [ffplayer](https://github.com/rockcarry/ffplayer) or [gstreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) ( for sound expansion for kivy )
